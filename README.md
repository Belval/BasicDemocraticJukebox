A basic jukebox with Django that doesn't require login and uses a file upload system to add songs

# FAQ
## Why make another Jukebox WebApp?
Because I searched for something very basic and I couldn't find anything that wouldn't require my guest to create an account and log in to vote.

## How do you prevent people from voting multiple times?
I use a system based on Django's session 

## Is it not very easy to abuse?
Yes, I wouldn't use it for anything that isn't a small party on a local network.

## Will it work on my phone?
Yes, it uses bootstrap for styling so it should render well on any +4 inches smartphone.
